# üèóÔ∏è Module 09 Mini-Project: Complete Fetch Requests for Existing Application

In this mini-project, you'll work with a group to complete `fetch` requests for an existing application. You'll create `fetch` requests to get national park information and events, based on an inputted state, as well as requests to add and remove search history.  

* As a user, I want to see nearby national parks and events when I search by state.

* As a user, I want my previous searches to be displayed.

* As a user, when I click on a previously searched state, I want to see national parks and events in that state.

* As a user, I want to be able to remove previously searched states from my search history.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I submit the form with the name of a state and nearby national parks and events display on the page.

* It's done when I load the page and my previous searches load as buttons.

* It's done when I click on a previous search button and national parks and events in that state display on the page.

* It's done when I click on the delete icon (trash can) next to a previously searched state and that state is removed from the search history.

## Additional Requirements

* This application requires environment variables to function properly. You'll need to rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

* Additionally, you'll need an API key from the [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm). Once you've obtained that key, add it to the `.env` file as the `API_KEY` value.

* The server-side of this application is provided. Familiarize yourself with the provided server and routes before writing your code.

## üí° Hints

* How can we test Express routes without a front-end application?

* Which HTTP methods would be appropriate for the requested functionality?
